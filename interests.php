		<br />
		<p>Getting into penspinning is quite easy. You grab a more or less balanced pen, look at a video tutorial online and practice &mdash; that's it.</p>
		<p>It is, of course, more fun when you also get involved with the community. The largest international board on the topic of penspinning is the <a href="http://forum.upsb.info/forum.php">UPSB</a>, I guess. Most contries also have their own board/community. Try to look out for gatherings. It's most fun when you meet other spinners in person and talk to them. :)</p>
		<br />
		<p>After I started penspinning in 2007 I actively did it &mdash; meaning I really took my time to practice, looked out for new tricks to learn, etc. &mdash; for maybe a year and a half. Since then I only do it casually, barely try or practice new stuff ... but it's still a lot of fun to do it and I don't plan to stop. :)</p>

		<h1>Kyogi Karuta</h1>
		<p><em>難波津に…</em></p>
		<br />
		<img src="img/interests/karuta.jpg" alt="karuta.jpg" />
		<br />
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karuta">Karuta</a> (かるた) is a Japanese card game based on the poem collection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogura_Hyakunin_Isshu">Ogura Hyakunin Isshu</a> (小倉百人一首) — often just called the Hyakunin Issu (百人一首) — by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Teika">Fujiwara no Teika</a> (藤原 定家).</p>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_karuta">Kyogi karuta</a> (競技かるた) means playing かるた in a competitive manner.</p>
		<br />
		<p>An English version of the rules of kyogi karuta can be found <a href="http://karuta.game.coocan.jp/simplerule-e.html">here</a>. Further useful resources:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.karuta.or.jp/">Japan Karuta Association</a> (up-to-date information about tournaments)</li>

		<li><a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/japanese/hyakunin/index.html">Hyakunin Isshu overview with english translations</a></li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p>To get an idea of how kyogi karuta is played, watch one of the following videos:</p>
		<?php echo youtubedd('Explanatory karuta match with English commentary', 'nKAmZxVhQww'); ?>
		<?php echo youtubedd('Recording of a karuta match with visual aids and slow motion replays', 'BiID7_0aqsc'); ?>

		</ul>
		<br />
		<p>A fun way to learn more about the world of karuta would be reading the manga <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihayafuru">Chihayafuru</a> or watching the anime adaptaion.</p>

		<h1>Mechanical keyboards</h1>
		<p><em>High quality input devices. :3</em></p>
		<br />
		<img src="img/interests/mechkb.png" alt="mechkb.png" />
		<br />
		<p>Most keyboards today are so called <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome">rubber dome</a> or <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Scissor_switch">scissor switch</a> keyboards. They're cheap to produce and do their job. There are, however, other types of keyboards which in general are referred to as <em>mechanical keyboards</em>.</p>
	<br />
	<p>The exact mechanisms of how mechanical keyboard switches work differ from each other. In most cases the switches of one vendor have colored stems which give them their name and indicate their tactile and acoustic behaviour. More information can be found in the <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Category:Keyboard_switches">deskthority wiki</a>.</p>
	<p>The reason for most people to use a mechanical keyboard is the higher quality and durability, the fact that you can choose a swich type that fits your "taste" the best and generally the more comfortable feeling when typing. If you're interested in the topic be sure to check out <a href="http://geekhack.org/">geekhack.org</a> and <a href="http://deskthority.net/">deskthority.net</a>.</p>
	<br />
	<p>I myself use a KBC Poker with Cherry MX Blue switches as primary keyboard (the one on top on the picture above) and I also own a Leopold FC500RT/AB with MX Browns (middle) as well as a SteelSeries 7G with MX Blacks (bottom).</p>

		<h1>Lock picking</h1>
		<p><em>Locks are meant to keep honest people honest.</em></p>
		<br />
		<p>If you are interested in lock picking you might want to take a look at the <a href="http://lockpickguide.com/support-files/mitguidetolockpick.pdf">MIT Guide to Lock Picking</a>. Also a great start is Schuyler Towne's video series <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CD42F86F3A1F85">Locks: Basic operation and manipulation</a>.</p>
		<p>Further places to look for interesting content include <a href="http://toool.us/">TOOOL</a> (The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers) and the <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives.html">DEF CON Media Archives Portal</a>, where you can find a lot of recorded talks on the subject of lock picking and physical security in general.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I only have more or less basic knowledge of lock mechanics and very limited experience in picking locks. But I definitely try to get more into it.</p>

		<h1>Speedrunning</h1>
		<p><em>Playing through games quickly, skillfully, and legitimately.</em></p>
		<br />
		<img src="img/interests/hl.gif" alt="hf.gif" />
		<br />
		<p>Concerning what I know about speedruns the place to go is the <a href="http://speeddemosarchive.com/">Speed Demos Archive</a>. If you want to get a general idea of what a speedrun is and what a speedrunner does, take a look at:</p>
		<?php
			echo	youtubedd("Portal Done Pro", "W1U5RUVENNE");
		?>
		<p><em>and</em> the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL359B764A0A3B8188">Portal Done Pro - Commentary Video</a>. Note that this run does not comply with the rules of SDA and is not listed there. Nonetheless does it give a nice impression of what speedrunning means. A very entertaining way to learn a bit more about speedruns can be following one of SDA's <a href="http://marathon.speeddemosarchive.com/">marathons</a>, where a group of speedrunners plays through a ton of games in a few days. Most of them comment on what they are doing while playing, so you get an insight on what the key techniques are for running a particular game.</p>
		<br />
		<p>As opposed to speedruns gathered at SDA there are also runs called TAS, tool-assisted speedruns. I don't know a lot about them, but I guess <a href="http://tasvideos.org/">TASVideos</a> is a good resource to start with.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I myself never did serious speedrunning. Further down some casual (and old) stuff.</p>
		<br />
		<?php
			echo "<p><strong>Portal</strong></p>".
				youtubedd("Testchamber 14 done in 4 seconds", "ocARZ9qdx_I").
			"<br /><p><strong>Half-Life</strong></p>".
				youtubedd("Hazard Course done in 3:23min", "2gG5PCDWQJ4");
