[{"date":"2013-06-18","headline":"\u6f22\u5b57 \u2014 100+","text":"<p>So, a mere 5% of J\u014dy\u014d kanji made their way into my head \u2014 and it's been fun so far, A LOT actually! :O<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>I can't really say why exactly, but I guess first off because as I continue learning kanji I'm able to read more and more Japanese stuff and also because I can play around with mnemonics. :3<\/p>\r\n<p>When I wrote about taking Japanese courses in my last post I was totally hyped. But in no way was I ready to get into kanji. I did a lot of preparation because the task seemed (and still seems) huge and I wanted to approach it in the best way possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>I thought about learning the 214 radicals before looking at a single kanji, I looked at guides like TextFugu and WaniKani and started hoarding useful resources like <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.csse.monash.edu.au\/~jwb\/cgi-bin\/wwwjdic.cgi?1R\\\">Jim Breen's Multi-Radical Selection<\/a> ...<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>... after about a month I knew how I would do it: TextFugu and the like present a great method for learning kanji effectively, but there are two problems. Frist they focus on kanji only and don't present them in context, as compounds (afaik). Second and most imporantly, they use given mnemonics. No way in hell does it make sense to use other people's associations to remember stuff. If \u8089 for me consists of a large gripper and two people which reminds me of Soylent Green and makes it super easy to remember then why should I try to remember it any other way?<\/p>\r\n<p>The thing with the official radicals is that sometimes they don't make sense to me, and for a lot of graphemes of given kanji there are no radicals. I cannot remember \u5202 as a mere variation of \u5200 \u2014 they need very distinct mnemonic names\/meanings or I'll mix them up.<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>So ... learning kanji for me works like this: I search for kanji made up of parts I already introduced to my mnemonic system that I'll use in sentences a lot. If I find no good candidates, I search for new graphemes\/parts that will \\\"enable\\\" useful new kanji. As a new useful kanji is found I try to find at least two ways to use it in sentences \u2014 one where a kun reading is used and one where an on reading is used. Super easy example: I know \u7530 and \u529b, now I find \u7537, super easy to remember and with \u7537\u306e\u5b50 and \u7537\u5b50 I already have two readings involved. \u7537 with it's readings, meanings and a mnemonic wind up in a json file from which I generate a wep page displaying all my kanji with memonics and their parts\/graphemes linked for ease of use. \u7537\u306e\u5b50 and \u7537\u5b50 are fresh input for my kanji deck in <a href=\\\"http:\/\/ankisrs.net\/\\\">Anki<\/a>. In the following days I then try to use \u7537\u306e\u5b50 and \u7537\u5b50 in homework for my Japanese courses and in journals on <a href=\\\"http:\/\/lang-8.com\/\\\">Lang-8<\/a>.

A while ago I read about that fantastic idea of making the caps lock key behave like escape on <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.kindofautomatic.de\/newblog\/?a=0db0b24f7\\\">Wolfgang's blog<\/a>. Which is really an awesome thing, especially for vim users.<\/p><p>But we don't want to eliminate caps lock. We want to make use of it. So: I recently switched from a German keyboard layout to a standard US one. Quite soon I realized, that I woudn't mind writing umlauts (&auml;&ouml;&uuml;) as ae, oe, ue but I'd really miss the s z ligature &szlig;.<\/p><p>It then occured to me (i.e. after wining about it on irc someone reminded me) that I could use compose. Which I, till then, only used for my beloved dash (&mdash;).<\/p><br \/><p>But something was bothering me: while the origins of the &szlig; are a bit complicated (the story includes the <a href=\\\"http:\/\/graphemica.com\/%C5%BF\\\">long s<\/a> (&#383;), a character that isn't used anymore, and there were different versions of the ligature using either the z or the s) and German speaking countries that don't use the &szlig;, like Swizerlad, use <em>ss<\/em> instead, it's present name <em>Eszett<\/em> (naming the letters <em>s<\/em> and <em>z<\/em>) and things like the HTML entity being &amp;szlig; (s z ligature) make the &szlig; &mdash; for me at least &mdash; more a ligature of s and z than of s and s. Yet, the default compose sequence for &szlig; is ss. I had to change that.<\/p><br \/><p>While creating my own <a href=\\\"https:\/\/wiki.archlinux.org\/index.php\/Accents_on_US_keyboards#Key_combinations\\\">.XCompose<\/a> file I had the idea to create compose sequences for <a href=\\\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hiragana\\\">hiragana<\/a> (the reason why that's useful to me is a whole other story).

Would be quite annoying to be forced to hit the compose key (mapped to the <a href=\\\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Menu_key\\\">menu key<\/a> in my case) for each and every hiragana.

In the case of AniDB the focus lies on the anime episodes you have stored somewhere, MyAnimelist cares more about what episodes you saw.<\/p><p>XDCC bots are IRC bots that send you files on demand. They are a common distribution method for fansubbed anime and offer so called packlists, where the list all the files they offer.<\/p><br \/><p>Now to the real story: I'm a user of both AniDB and MyAnimelist, but I only maintain a list on the latter. I use AniDB of keeping up to date with newly released episodes of airing series. The problem is, that if you only want to see notifies for new releases of certain subgroups, you have to add episodes of the respective anime <em>from that subgroup<\/em> to your list. I, however, don't maintain a list on that site, so I'd get a ton of unnecessary notifies.<\/p><br \/><p>Now, since I get all my new episodes from XDCC bots I though I could make use of simply parsing their packlists, which was the first thing I did: write a <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tareksaier.square7.ch\/animu\/entries.json\\\">JSON file<\/a> with all neccessary info, a small PHP script to parse the packlist and a <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tareksaier.square7.ch\/animu\/\\\">minimalistic site<\/a> to display the output. With that I always had an up to date list of all released episodes of the series I watch <em>and only from the subgroup I want them from<\/em>.<\/p><p>The problem with that approach was, that I had to memorize the number of the last episode I saw for every of those anime. So I had to come up with something different. Since MyAnimelist always has the information on which episode of which anime I watched last it seemed natural to use that. Also, since I open the page with <a href=\\\"http:\/\/myanimelist.net\/animelist\/IllDepence\\\">my list<\/a> on it several times a day, it seemed to be a good idea to simply include the information about new episodes there.<\/p><br \/><p>So I wanted to write a userscript that should obtain the information from both my JSON file and the packlists, look at the site itself and, if there were any episodes released that I hadn't seen, inform me about that ... well, <em>same origin policy says no<\/em>. The userscript is written in JavaScript and common browsers won't let it perform an XMLHttpRequest for stuff stored on other servers than the one the site you are viewing when the script is executed is hosted on.<\/p><p>I had to find a workaround and I though of JSONP, a method where you create a new script tag in the head of the site with the remote thing you want to access as the src attribute of that tag. Problem is, that remote thing should be a string with a JavaScript method call, so that you actually can use what you got from the remote server. But I wanted to access packlists I had no control over. It then came to my mind, that I simply could write a PHP script that would access and parse the packlist and return a JSONP string &mdash; a JSONP proxy you could say. ^^ And then access this with my userscript.<\/p><br \/><p>This is what I ended up doning. :) My <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tareksaier.square7.ch\/animu\/jsonp.php\\\">JSONProxy<\/a> parses packlists based on my <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tareksaier.square7.ch\/animu\/entries.json\\\">listing<\/a> of urls, titles and subgroups and my <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tareksaier.bplaced.net\/notHP\/mab\/MALandBots.user.js\\\">userscript<\/a> (<a href=\\\"http:\/\/tareksaier.bplaced.net\/notHP\/mab\/mab.js\\\">actual code<\/a>) uses that to inform me about new episodes. :3<\/p><br \/><p>I guess it would be quite easy to write a universal JSONProxy which takes a get parameter (the url to the document one wants to access) and returns a JavaScript method call with the whole site as a parameter. What I'm not sure about is, wether or not there are regulations on the src attribute of script tags and how messy the escaping of whole websites for the JS method call would get. ^^<\/p><p>Oh and by the way: since the actual request to the site you do not control (in my case the packlists) is not performed by the browser the JS is running on but by the PHP script on your server this method doesn't even violate the same origin policy more than JSONP itself &mdash; it's just a handy way to access data from other servers when you write userscripts. :)<\/p>","id":"bc07419d"},{"date":"2012-06-14","headline":"VZ Netzwerke message backup","image":"vzmb.jpg","text":"<p>A few days ago I read that the <em>VZ Netzwerke<\/em> (a group of dying social networks once popular in Germany) will be renamed to or restarted as <em>idpool<\/em>.

The following days I was really keen on further communication &mdash; text based due to distance, which, on a side note, actually isn't a bad thing at all. Talking seems to be the right thing to do in order to share experiences, writing appears to be predestined for getting to know someone's wolrd of thought. Anyway: communication at first went fine, but after a while I had the feeling my conversational partner lost interest. The atmosphere kind of infected me and I got all gloomy and listless. This really annoyed me and I tried to find a way out of my bad mood. I thought about what the situation was, what I wanted it to be or how I could view it from a different perspective so that it looked all good again. And then it struck me: <em>\\\"Hey ... you're talking to an interesting person. Most people, when you give them some kind of input, come out with some average ouput you won't really consider to be interesting. Here you got someone that, given input, grants you valuable, interesting ouput in exchange. Why don't you simply ask whether or not there's still interest in further communication, whether or not you're annoying\/uninteresting? If there's still interest and you're not annoying: go ahead and enjoy this rare personality you consider yourself fortunate having become acquainted with.\\\"<\/em><\/p><p>All of a sudden my mood turned from pretty down to fully enthusiastic again. : )<\/p><p>All I did was to take the present situation and put it in a nice frame so that it looked pleasant and motivating again.

The companies have stands in the hallways and lecture rooms where they introduce themselves. Students walk around to gather information relevant for a practical semester or thesis and harvest giveaways, mostly pens. One of the companies present was <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.oxid-esales.com\\\">OXID eSales<\/a>, they make online shops with PHP. The cool thing at their stand was, that they had t-shirts with PHP code (and their logo ofc) on them which they gave away for free. I quite like PHP, I had to get one of them, so did some of my fellow students. We continued our raid for pens ...<\/p><p>Then I realized something. The t-shirts that OXID gave away where exactly the same t-shits that their employees wore at their stand. I continued on that thought: people wearing such a shirt standing at their stand are thought to be OXID employees and they're asked questions about the company by students that walk by. I now possess such a shirt ...<\/p><p>By now you probably figured out what I was about to do. I asked one of my mates what he thought about temporarily becoming and OXID employee. He liked the idea, we put the t-shirts on and headed off to OXID. In the end the area around the stand wasn't quite crowded enough for the plan to succeed, but the OXID employees that spotted us \\\"supporting their team\\\" happened to find it amusing what we did. As you can see they even took a picture of us at their stand.<\/p><br \/><h2>iCTF<\/h2><p>At university we had a team that took part in <a href=\\\"http:\/\/ictf.cs.ucsb.edu\\\">The UCSB iCTF<\/a>, an international capture the flag event.

As a kid I was in a gymnastics club. I quitted at the age of 12, I guess, and then, for a long, long time ... nothing. At 19 I tried to get into tricking but it didn't really work out. Tricking to me still is one of the &mdash; if not the &mdash; most beautiful expression of movement, though.<\/p><p>Early this year I got into slacklining, which I still like a lot and do occasionally. But what got me super excited the moment I started was parkour. Or freerunning, or whatever may describe it best what I'm doing. I really don't care a lot about definitions and categories. As long as it isn't necessary to rate or compare within a discipline you don't need to restrict yourself to a certain set of operations or comply to any regulations. And since I'm not driven by the thought <em>\\\"I wan't to be good at parkour\\\"<\/em> but instead <em>\\\"I wan't to do what makes me happy and what I think is fun\\\"<\/em> I just do that: moving and improving &mdash; in whatever way I like to. : )<\/p><br \/><p>What I find particularly interesting regarding parkour is the philosophy that developed around it. First there is the thought <em>\\\"never stop playing\\\"<\/em> and I couldn't identify more with it. Second there is the idea of creatively using (urban) spaces which I really like. It makes parkour kind of an art that's reaching into the spehre of everyday public life. Third there is this search for efficiency in not only movement but also thinking. It's really a whole bunch of good ideas and interestinng thought that comes along with parkour.<\/p><br \/><p>On top of that &mdash; one last incredibly important thing &mdash; the people are great. From what I've experienced so far, people that are into parkour tend to be extremely supportive, nice, open minded and fun. You'll get help if you need, everyone will encourage each other to try new things. It's just a great environment that supports one's authenticity.<\/p><br \/><p>Thus at the moment I'm a bit obsessed with parkour, freerunning, movement in genereal.

It has a touch of such works, yet tells a story, keeps you interestend, is written gorgeously and altogether is just a wonderful book. *recommended*<\/p>","id":"04e9b323"},{"date":"2011-06-23","headline":"Renovation, again.","image":"renovation.jpg","text":"<p>Uhm, yes ...

Turns out a lot of free time doesn't seem to be the best thing for my learning efforts. I tend to approach other time consuming stuff that wouldn't be possible alongside lectures and end up having a hard time keeping up with making progress with my Japanese. D:<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>Looking at my <a href=\\\"img\/blog\/anki_stats_130903.png\\\" \/>Anki stats<\/a> for the last month: the mostly hidden larger gap responsible for that first huge bar was a 5 day trip to Munic for a parkour jam, next gap was a spontaneous programming project iirc (something that doesn't show up in my Google calendar at least) and the third gap was Ludum Dare 27, a video game development competition.<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>Anyway: what I'm experimenting with right now is different methods for choosing which kanji to learn next. For some time I sticked with the JLPT kanji listed <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tangorin.com\/common_kanji\\\">here<\/a>, but it seems to take me longer and longer to find good candidates. I consider switching to going through easy reading material online and adding stuff I don't know yet. Another option would be using some frequency list.<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>Apart from that everything's going well. Creating mnemonics is still fun. :) Oh and when learning with Anki I now write out readings in katakana instead of hiragana from time to time \u2014 helps preventing that I forget those bastards. :D<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>Again, for the sake of documentation, these are the kanji I know so far:<\/p>\r\n<p>\u4e00\u53f3\u96e8\u5186\u738b\u97f3\u4e0b\u706b\u82b1\u8c9d\u5b66\u4f11\u7389\u91d1\u4e5d\u7a7a\u6708\u72ac\u898b\u4e94\u53e3\u6821\u5de6\u4e09\u5c71\u56db\u5b50\u5b57\u8033\u4e03\u8eca\u5341\u51fa\u5973\u5c0f\u4e0a\u68ee\u4eba\u6c34\u6b63\u751f\u5148\u5343\u5ddd\u65e9\u6751\u5927\u7537\u4e2d\u866b\u753a\u5929\u7530\u571f\u4e8c\u65e5\u5165\u5e74\u767d\u516b\u767e\u6587\u672c\u540d\u6728\u76ee\u5915\u7acb\u529b\u516d\u4f55\u4f1a\u56de\u5916\u9593\u725b\u9b5a\u8fd1\u5144\u8a08\u8a00\u53e4\u5348\u8a9e\u5de5\u884c\u9ad8\u56fd\u9ed2\u4eca\u59c9\u5e02\u601d\u6b62\u5bfa\u6642\u81ea\u5ba4\u793e\u9996\u9031\u66f8\u5c11\u5834\u98df\u5fc3\u65b0\u661f\u524d\u591a\u4f53\u77e5\u671d\u9577\u5200\u8aad\u5185\u8089\u8cb7\u58f2\u534a\u7236\u98a8\u5206\u805e\u7c73\u6bcd\u65b9\u59b9\u6bce\u4e07\u660e\u9580\u77e2\u53cb\u66dc\u6765\u91cc\u8a71\u5b89\u6697\u54e1\u592e\u5316\u6025\u8efd\u4ed5\u4f7f\u6b7b\u8a69\u4e8b\u4e3b\u53d6\u4f4f\u91cd\u7533\u795e\u52d5\u7269\u554f\u7531\u904a\u7f8a\u82f1\u8a13\u597d\u6628\u672d\u53f2\u5468\u4fe1\u9054\u7f6e\u50cd\u4e0d\u592b\u672b\u672a\u826f\u6613\u96d1\u5e38\u820c\u8cb4\u79c1\u81f3\u8a5e\u8a8c\u5bf8\u5409\u8a70\u4f8d\u4e08\u5bdd\u5f7c\u53c8\u95c7\u5dfe\u8ab0\u6795<\/p>\r\n\r\n","id":"6a66c49c","date":"2013-09-03","headline":"\u6f22\u5b57 \u2014 200+","image":"kanji_checkpoint_2.png"}]
